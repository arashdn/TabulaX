Classify the following data transformations into one of the classes.
Classes: [`String`, `Numbers`, `Algorithmic`, `General`]

String: When The values on both sides are presenting a similar text, and they have many common subsequences of text.
Numbers: When both side are a numeric value.
Algorithmic: When the values on one or two sides are not numbers and an algorithm can be used to transform them, For example Date conversions, Unicode conversions, etc.
General: Anything that may need external knowledge and does not fit in the above classes.

Examples:
Data: ("Arash Nobari Dargahi" -> "a. n. dargahi"), ("Davood Rafiei" -> "d.rafiei"),
Class: String


Data: ("587-123-8541" -> "587"), ("800-250-6582" -> "800"),
Class: String


Data: ("582.1" -> "622"), ("200" -> "800"),
Class: Numbers


Data: ("2015/12/1" -> "1433/11/08"), ("2024/1/2" -> "1350/5/17"),
